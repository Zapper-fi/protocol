# Overview

Reviewer is the term used by Zap Protocl to identify community members that are responsible to approve event interpretation submissions.

To be a reviewer, users have to be proficient in event interpretations. Only EI super users can have access to review.

If it’s your first time interpreting events, visit the [Event Interpretation Guide](docs/Interpretation/event-interpretation/overview.md)

If you want to join the reviewer community, jump in the [Discord](https://zapper.xyz/discord) or [Telegram](https://t.me/+mAVxPRsA7bE3ZDkx) to manifest your interest.

Once you have the reviewer access, you will see a new tab called Review, under the curate section.

## The role of a reviewer

The role of the reviewer is to confirm that transactions submitted by other community members represent what happened onchain.

:::Note

To do so, it has to be accurate, complete and consistent jump to [Canonical description](guide/canonical-description.md) for standard verbs to use for consistency.

:::info

This is a super important role since after going through your approval, all similar transactions will be readable, following the logic you approved.

:::

The reviewer can make adjustments to the Event interpretation before approving it. They also have the ability to reject or put a submission on hold if they feel some information is missing to have an accurate representation of what happened.

Once approved, Zap Protocol takes the user’s description and uses it to describe ALL transactions that match:
1. **The contract** address
2. **The method**, also referred to as the sighash
3. **The network**, a given contract address can exist on multiple networks

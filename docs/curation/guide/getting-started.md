# Getting Started

The review process starts in the Reviewer Dashboard. 

:::info

By default, all transactions are filtered on pending. These are the ones that need to be reviewed. 

:::

The table gives some basic information about each event, such as 
- The network the event happened on
- The description entered by the submitter
- The app 
- The user that submitted the event

Overall, the process of reviewing is pretty simple. To explore the detailed step by step, jump to the [step by step review section](./step-by-step-review.md)
- Choose an event to review
- Get more context on the chosen event
- Review the submission
- Approve or Reject

:::tip

It might be easier to start with events that happened on apps you are familiar with, or some type of transactions that you have yourself made in the past.

:::

Once you have selected an event you are interested in reviewing, simply click on the line to open up the review page.

## Page Overview

On the left side of the review page, you will find the event information submitted by the interpreter. Here you can modify, add, or remove any of the information submitted. 
To do so, click on the pen to modify an element, and click on the X to delete an element. You can also modify the action verbs by deleting the text and entering a new one.

On the right side of the page, you will find the preview feed that will help you confirm if the event has been correctly interpreted for all events or not. Scroll down to see a total of 12 different events with the same method to make sure everything looks good and returns the right information.

To help your reviewing, there are some resources available to you to provide additional context:
- The contract address
- The Zapper transaction card
- The chain explorer

:::tip

It is highly recommended to get a full picture of the event before approving or rejecting. See the next section for how to follow the right steps.

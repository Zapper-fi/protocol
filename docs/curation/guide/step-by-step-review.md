# Step by Step Review

## Decision making and step by step diagram

To ensure quality across all interpretations, a reviewer should always validate some important elements of the EI before approving it. 

The below diagram can be used as a checklist to go through before approving or rejecting an event 

> **Note**: Please do so, even if the preview feed indicates that all events are returning a result

### Approving an Event

If you feel like the event interpretation is accurate, complete, and consistent with other similar transactions, it is ready to roll. You can go to the bottom of the review page to press “Save and Approve”.

This will confirm the event interpretation and interpret all similar events for everyone to see! How cool is that?!

:::note
After hitting the “save and approve” button, the status of the event will change from Pending to Enabled.

### Rejecting an Event

Some events submitted might require to be rejected for different reasons. Here are possible reasons to reject an event interpretation:
- The event has already been interpreted by someone else before, duplicate
- The event needs more details to be complete, and you could not find the details through your research
- Duplicate from the same user. Some users may sent multiple submissions for the same event if they don't know that one interpretation covers them all
- Spam, a user sends multiple interpretations without actually providing info

# Create a TVL fetcher

## What is TVL?

**TVL** stands for _total value locked_. It is the total amount of staked
cryptocurrency within an app that is actively earning interest, being used as
collateral, and so on. Let's take a look at a few examples:

- The TVL in **Uniswap V2** is the total amount of trading liquidity across all
  of its liquidity pools
- The TVL in **Aave V2** is the total amount of supplied collateral across the
  Aave V2 market
- The TVL in **Lido** on **Ethereum** is the total amount of ETH in their liquid
  staking (stETH)

## What is a TVL fetcher?

If you've been through the previous sections, you might already have a good idea
about what this might be.

In the Zapper API, a `TVLFetcher` class is an adapter that retrieves the TVL of
an app on a single network. Considering that applications have different
contracts and implementations, the fetcher is abstract so that the developer can
choose the appropriate strategy to retreive this TVL.

If you're implementing a `TVLFetcher` in Zapper, you might have good success
looking at implementations in the impressive library built out by the
[DefiLlama Team](https://github.com/DefiLlama/DefiLlama-Adapters).

## Generate a TVL fetcher

Our codegen utilities will automatically generate the boilerplate for a TVL
fetcher. Run `pnpm studio create-tvl-fetcher pickle`. When prompted for the
network, select `ethereum`.

## Implement the TVL fetcher

Let's open `src/apps/pickle/ethereum/pickle.tvl-fetcher.ts`. The skeleton has
been assembled for you, and you'll need to fill in the contents of the `getTvl`
method in the `EthereumPickleTvlFetcher` class.

```ts
import { Inject } from "@nestjs/common";

import { Register } from "~app-toolkit/decorators";
import { APP_TOOLKIT, IAppToolkit } from "~lib";
import { TvlFetcher } from "~stats/tvl/tvl-fetcher.interface";
import { Network } from "~types/network.interface";

import PICKLE_DEFINITION from "../pickle.definition";

const appId = PICKLE_DEFINITION.id;
const network = Network.ETHEREUM_MAINNET;

@Register.TvlFetcher({ appId, network })
export class EthereumPickleTvlFetcher implements TvlFetcher {
  constructor(@Inject(APP_TOOLKIT) private readonly appToolkit: IAppToolkit) {}

  async getTvl() {
    return 0;
  }
}
```

If you add this class as a provider to your `AppModule` in
`src/apps/pickle/pickle.module.ts`, you'll be able to retrieve the TVL by
visiting `http://localhost:5001/apps/pickle/tvl`.

However, since we previously calculated the TVL as a data property for each jar
token in a previous section of this tutorial, we can simply retrieve all vault
tokens, and sum the TVL!

```ts
// ...

@Register.TvlFetcher({ appId, network })
export class EthereumPickleTvlFetcher implements TvlFetcher {
  constructor(@Inject(APP_TOOLKIT) private readonly appToolkit: IAppToolkit) {}

  async getTvl() {
    const tokens =
      await this.appToolkit.getAppTokenPositions<PickleJarTokenDataProps>({
        appId,
        groupIds: [PICKLE_DEFINITION.groups.jar.id],
        network,
      });

    return sumBy(tokens, (v) => v.dataProps.tvl);
  }
}
```

We're done! Hit the TVL endpoint again and you'll see the TVL of Pickle on the
Ethereum network. We're ready to submit our code to the reviewers, and get your
application integration merged to Zapper! âš¡

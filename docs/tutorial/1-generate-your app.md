# Generate your app

In this guide, we are going to integrate
[Pickle Finance](https://pickle.finance/) as a Zapper application from scratch.

## Before we begin

Ensure that [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is installed in your system and you are
running least node v14.

## What is Pickle?

**Pickle** is cross-chain a yield aggregator application that uses **vaults** to
auto-compound yield of your underlying tokens.

For example, at the time of writing (April 2022), you could deposit your
**CVX/ETH** pool tokens from **Curve** into a Pickle Jar on Ethereum Mainnet.
The jar employs a strategy to deposit these tokens into the **Convex** yield
farm, periodically harvest the yield, and then buy/stake more pool tokens with
the yield. As a result, the compounded APY becomes almost **35%**!

Similarly, opportunities for aggregating yield exist on other chains as well. On
**Polygon**, you can deposit your **QI/MATIC** pool tokens from **QuickSwap** in
the same way.

Clone the repository to your local machine, then create a new branch to capture
your changes.

## Install dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in a
terminal window:

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Generate your app folder

Use the provided CLI to bootstrap most of the application code required for
building an integration. In a new terminal window, run:

pnpm studio create-app
```

You will be prompted to enter the **name**, **unique identifier** (generated by
default as the lower-kebab-case variant of your app's name), **description**,
and **URL**, and the supported **networks** for this application.

Once completed, you'll see new files generated under `src/apps/<app_id>` in your
repo. We'll begin by exploring the definition file in the following section.

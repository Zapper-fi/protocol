# Net Worth

Calculate the total value of NFT holdings for one or more wallet addresses across networks.

---

### `nftNetWorth`

The `nftNetWorth` query takes an array of addresses and optionally a specific network to calculate the total estimated value of all NFTs held by these addresses. The value is returned in USD.

### Example Use Case: Portfolio Valuation

When you need to display the total value of a user's NFT portfolio, either across all networks or for a specific network, you can use this query to get an aggregated value in USD.

#### Example Variables

```js
{
  "addresses": [
    "0x3d280fde2ddb59323c891cf30995e1862510342f",
    "0x52c8ff44260056f896e20d8a43610dd88f05701b"
  ],
  "network": "ETHEREUM_MAINNET",
  "withOverrides": false
}
```

#### Example Query

```graphql
query($addresses: [Address!]!, $network: Network, $withOverrides: Boolean) {
  nftNetWorth(
    addresses: $addresses
    network: $network
    withOverrides: $withOverrides
  )
}
```

#### Example Response

```js
{
  "data": {
    "nftNetWorth": "674674.21588506319435"
  }
}
```

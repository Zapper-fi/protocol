| 1. Has the transaction already been interpreted?                            | Reject the submission and add a reason.                              | Go to next step                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Open the transaction on Zapper to see if it’s labeled as did something.                                                                                                                                                         |
| 2. Is the verb or description used to describe the initial action accurate? | Go to next step.                                                     | 1. Adjust the verb and description to make it accurate or to standardize it. See - [Transaction Description](/docs/interpretation/event-interpretation/guide/action-verb)<br/> 2. Go to next step                                                                                                                | Open the explorer to see more details on the transaction.<br/> The method name can also be a good indicator.                                                                                                                    |

Change the item type for a token transfer to be more accurate.                               |
| 5. Does the preview return a value for all 12 previewed transactions?       | Go to next step                                                      | 1. Investigate the transactions with missing information. i.e. open explorer<br/> 2. You might have to select a more inclusive item type. Go back to question 4.<br/> 3. If you find that you have to create a conditional transaction, create a new case and confirm the new preview before moving to next step | Failed transactions will be displayed as incomplete previews.<br/> If all the incomplete transactions in the preview are failed ones, carry on to next step                                                                     |

| 8. Are you able to find the app yourself?                                   | Go to next step                                                      | 1.

### Approving a Transaction

If the transaction interpretation is accurate, complete, and consistent, it is ready for approval. Go to the bottom of the review page and press “Save and Approve”.

This will confirm the transaction interpretation and apply it to all similar transactions.

:::note
After hitting the “Save and Approve” button, the status changes from Pending to Enabled.
:::

### Rejecting a Transaction

Some transactions may need to be rejected for various reasons:

- The transaction has already been interpreted (duplicate)
- The transaction needs more details to be complete, and these details couldn't be found through research
- Duplicate submissions from the same user
- Spam submissions lacking substantive information

:::note
After hitting the “Reject” button and selecting a reason, the transactions status changes from Pending to Rejected.

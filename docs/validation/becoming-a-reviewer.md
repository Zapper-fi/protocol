## Steps to Join the Reviewer Community

1. **Visit the Transaction Interpretation Guide**: If it’s your first time interpreting transactions, visit the [Transaction Interpretation Guide](../interpret/event-interpretation/guide/getting-started.md).
2. **Join the Community**: Join our [Discord](https://zapper.xyz/discord) or [Telegram](https://t.me/+OE0wMq01sNc5MTMx) to express your interest in becoming a reviewer.

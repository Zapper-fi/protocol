# Contract Positions

## What is a `ContractPosition`?

A `ContractPosition` object represents a position that is _not_ represented by a
token standard. It is often these positions that are more difficult to track by
simple wallet applications, and this is especially where Zapper shines at
decoding these positions from blockchain data. These positions may be used to
represent:

- Farming positions in **SushiSwap** Master Chef staking contracts
- Bonds in **Olympus** or other apps that aim to own their liquidity
- Leveraged positions like **Abracadabra** cauldrons or **Alchemix** alchemists
- Lending positions in **Compound** (Note: _Supply_ positions are represented by
  tokens!)
- Claimable airdrops across the Web3 ecosystem!

As a rule of thumb, you can identify `ContractPosition` as one you _can not_ add
to your Metamask wallet because they are _not_ tokenized! For example, once you
deposit a token into a SushiSwap Master Chef farm, your wallet will likely not
be able to display this position.

## What is a `ContractPositionFetcher`?

In the Zapper API, a `ContractPositionFetcher` class dynamically lists a single
group of contract positions. Groups of contract positions share common
properties, such as APYs for **SushiSwap** farms, or collateralization limits
for **Alchemix** alchemists. As such, we declare unique strategy classes for
each contract position group that we want to index in Zapper.

## What are the properties of a contract position?

The following table describes the properties on the `ContractPosition` object.
You'll see there is quite a bit of overlap with an `AppToken`, except a
`ContractPosition` lacks the ERC20 properties, and cannot be priced because its
non-fungible.

| Property       | Example                                        | Description                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`         | `ContractType.POSITION`                        | Used to [discriminate types](https://css-tricks.com/typescript-discriminated-unions/), do not change.       |
| `address`      | `'0xa39739ef8b0231dbfa0dcda07d7e29faabcf4bb2'` | Address of the contract. Use the address that a user interacts with to enter this position.                 |
| `network`      | `Network.ETHEREUM`                             | Network of the contract.                                                                                    |
| `key`          | See below.                                     | Optional. A unique key that represents this contract position, used for aggregation purposes in Zapper.     |
| `appId`        | `'liquity'`                                    | The contract position belongs to this app                                                                   |
| `groupId`      | `'trove'`                                      | The contract position belongs to this app group                                                             |
| `tokens`       | `[supplied(ethToken), borrowed(lusdToken)]`    | The underlying token(s). For example, in a Liquity trove, the user deposits ETH as collateral to mint LUSD. |
| `dataProps`    | See below.                                     | Additional data props that might be useful to be passed in other areas of the application.                  |
| `displayProps` | See below.                                     | Properties used by Zapper Web and Zapper Mobile to render meaningful information to Zapper users.           |

## What are data props?

The `dataProps` field on a `ContractPosition` object is used for augmenting the
contract position object with additional data properties. These properties can
be used in other places in the application.

_Example_: In **Maker**, a user can open a vault by depositing collateral like
`ETH` or `WBTC`. The user can then mint `DAI` up to some collateralization
ratio. This collateralization ratio can be added to the `ContractPosition`
`dataProps`.

## What are display props?

The `displayProps` field on an `ContractPosition` object is used by Zapper Web
and Zapper Mobile to render meaningful information to Zapper users about this
contract position.

| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `label`  | `WBTC / ETH (14.28 to 19.98)` | The primary label for this contract position. In the **Uniswap V3** example, its useful to show the underlying tokens and the liquidity concentration range. |

## FAQ

### What `address` should I use for a `ContractPosition`?

The `address` field should be the address of the contract that a user can use to
_enter the position_. Zapper API can cross-reference a user's transactions to
these addresses to determine if a user has ever interacted with this app.

_Example 1_: In **SushiSwap**, the pool tokens are deposited into a farm
contract called `MasterChefV2`, but bonus rewards are claimable from separate
`Rewarder` contracts. Since the user deposits funds by interacting with the
`MasterChefV2` contract, you'll use this address in the `address` field. It may
be useful to add the `Rewarder` address to the contract position's `dataProps`
field.

_Example 2_: In **Yield Protocol**, a vault is opened by interacting with the
`Ladle` contract, but funds are stored in the `Cauldron` contract. It may be
tempting to use the `Cauldron` address in this case, but use the `Ladle` address
since this is the entrypoint of user's funds into the protocol.

### What is `key`? Why is it useful?

Similarly to the `key` property `AppToken`, the `key` is a unique identifier on
the position object that is used to aggregate contract position balances across
multiple addresses.

Usually, you can ignore setting the `key` and Zapper API will set the default as
`md5(<app_id>:<network>:<address>:<tokens_keys>)`, where `tokens_keys` is itself
`<app_id>:<network>:<address>:<metatype>` for each token in the contract
position's `tokens` array. However, in some circumstances, this is _not_ a
unique identifier, in which case, you can override the `key` property in your
contract position fetcher.

_Example 1_: In **FloorDAO**, a user can sell fractional NFT tokens to the
protocol treasury in return for a `FLOOR` token bond, which vests over a period
of time. The bonds are all on the same address, and have the same underlying
tokens: vesting and claimable `FLOOR`. However, if a bundle of addresses
included one address with a bond that was opened by selling `PUNK` and another
address with a bond that was opened by selling `MILADY`, these would be
aggregated into a _single balance_ because of the key collision! Instead, we'll
note that each bond has a `marketIndex`, and produce the key as simply
`md5(<app_id>:<network>:<address>:<market_index>)` to prevent collisions.

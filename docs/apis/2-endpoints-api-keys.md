# API Keys

The Zapper API uses
[API keys](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/api-keys/) to
authenticate requests. Zapper has made available for public use the following
API key:

`96e0cc51-a62e-42ca-acee-910ea7d2a241`

:::caution As of March 2022, Zapper began rate limiting query volume on the
**public API key**. See below for how to get a **private API key** if you are
hitting the rate limit on the public key. :::

## Getting a Private API key to get a higher rate limit

If you are hitting the rate limit on the Public Key, you should request a
private API key via Zapper's
[ZenDesk ticket](https://zapperfi.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) system. You
will be issued a private API key in 24-48 hours.

These private API keys still have a rate limit of 30RPM on the _balances_
endpoints and 1,000RPM on ALL endpoints collectively, which is significantly
higher than the public API key's rate limit.

If these rate limits are not sufficient, you may also request a higher rate
limit for your private API key by via the same ZenDesk ticket link, through
replying to it in your email.

### Testing endpoints using the API key on Swagger

You can test the available endpoints on Swagger by entering an API key (public
or private) **into the Authorize section in Swagger**. This will then allow you
to see the responses for various endpoints based on parameters you specify.

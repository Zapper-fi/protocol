# Contribute

1. **Curators** play a key role by finding uninterpreted transactions and positions, building interpreters, and making them human-readable. Anyone can start contributing without any coding knowledge.

2. **Reviewers** serve as the final quality control layer before data becomes publicly available. They review and validate submissions from Curators to ensure accurate interpretation. Reviewers are experienced Curators who have demonstrated consistent accuracy in contributing to Zapper Protocol.

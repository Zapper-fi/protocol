# Human-Readable Transactions


Presents onchain activity in a simple descriptive summary with references to dynamic elements of the transaction such as tokens, NFTs, and accounts. Great for use in account histories, social feeds, or app-specific feeds.

---

### `accountsTimeline`

The `accountsTimeline` query takes `addresses` input as an array, with optional `networks`. It returns a descriptive and human-readable summary of the transaction's details from one or multiple wallets with tokens transferred — paginated and chain-agnostic.

Typically, a single transaction generates multiple timeline events: one for each wallet impacted by the transaction and one for the associated application, if any.

### Example Use Case: Transaction History

Let's say you want to show users their onchain transactions in a human-readable format with network and app information. Start by passing `addresses` for the user. Then return `processedDescription`, `network`, and the `app` object with the fields `name` and `imgUrl`.

#### Example Variable

```js
{
  "addresses": ["0x52c8ff44260056f896e20d8a43610dd88f05701b"]
}
```

#### Example Query

```graphql
query($addresses: [Address!]) {
  accountsTimeline(addresses: $addresses) {
    edges {
      node {
        transaction {
          fromUser {
            address
            displayName {
              value
            }
          }
        }
        interpretation {
          processedDescription
        }
         app {
          name
          imgUrl
        }
        network
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

#### Example Response

```js
{
  "fromUser": {
    "address": "0x52c8ff44260056f896e20d8a43610dd88f05701b",
      "displayName": {
          "value": "0xjasper.eth"
          }
    },
    "interpretation": {
      "processedDescription": "Started battle with sebaudet.eth"
      },
      "app": {
            "name": "Tokiemon",
            "imgUrl": "https://storage.googleapis.com/zapper-fi-assets/apps%2Ftokiemon.png"
            },
      "network": "BASE_MAINNET"
}
```

:::note
Textual description of each transaction is presented from the perspective of the signer. Events with descriptions such as "Did something with …" indicate that an interpreter for that type of onchain interaction has not yet been curated through [interpretation](/docs/Interpretation/overview).

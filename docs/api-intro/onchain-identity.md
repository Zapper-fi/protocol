# Onchain Identity

Enrich your app by surfacing onchain identity such as avatars, ENS, Farcaster, and more.

---

### `account`

The `account` query takes an `address`. It returns fields such as `displayName`, `ensRecord`, `farcasterProfile`, `lensProfile`, and other identity primitives.

### Example Use Case: Social Profile

Let's say you are building a profile for users and want to surface their identity primitives. Start by passing `addresses` for the user. Then return `displayName` and `description` with their sources as well as information from `ensRecord`, `farcasterProfile`, and `lensProfile`.

#### Example Variable

```js
{
  "address": "0x52c8ff44260056f896e20d8a43610dd88f05701b"
}
```

#### Example Query

```graphql
query($address: Address!) {
  account(address: $address) {
    address
    displayName {
      value
      source
    }
    description {
      value
      source
    }
    ensRecord {
      name
    }
    farcasterProfile {
      username
      fid
    }
    lensProfile {
      handle
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example Response

```js
{
  "data": {
    "account": {
      "address": "0x52c8ff44260056f896e20d8a43610dd88f05701b",
      "displayName": {
        "value": "0xjasper.eth",
        "source": "ENS"
      },
      "description": {
        "value": "designer of stuff at Zapper",
        "source": "ENS"
      },
      "ensRecord": {
        "name": "0xjasper.eth"
      },
      "farcasterProfile": {
        "username": "jasper",
        "fid": 177
      },
      "lensProfile": {
        "handle": "0xjasper"
      }
    }
  }
}

```

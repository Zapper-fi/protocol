# Portfolio Totals 

Surfaces various aggregations of onchain portfolio data.

---


### `totals`

The `totals` field from the `portfolio` query takes `addresses` input as an array, with optional `networks`. It returns fields such as `total`, `totalWithNFT`, `totalByAddress`, `totalByNetwork`, and other aggregations of portfolio data.

### Example Use Case: Net Worth

You want to show a user the USD value of their entire onchain holdings across all tokens and apps â€” broken down by chain. Start by passing `address` into the `portfolio` and `totals` object. Then return `totalByNetwork`, `network`, and `total`.

#### Example Variable

```js
{
  "addresses": ["0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045"]
}
```

#### Example Query

```graphql
query($addresses: [Address!]!) {
  portfolio(addresses: $addresses) {
    totals {
      totalByNetwork {
        network
        total
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Example Response

```js
{
  "data": {
    "portfolio": {
      "totals": {
        "total": 11252.6887398181,
        "totalByNetwork": [
          {
            "network": "ETHEREUM_MAINNET",
            "total": 2936.7837588270454

          {

            "total": 2540.454378130174

# Preview Feed 

When interpreting your transaction, you will see the right side of your screen be updated automatically as you input new information about the transaction. This is a great tool to determine if you have interpreted all the transactions correctly or not. 

In the screenshot below, you can see that two transactions were not interpreted correctly, therefore the fields were not filled in with the right info, or maybe some details are missing.

This can happen if you are too specific in your interpretation or if the contract method does more than one action. In the later case you can submit a conditional event by adding a case to the interpretation, see the next section for more details. 

Important! Note that failed transactions can also appear in the preview, when this happens, you donâ€™t have to worry about the preview shown and can just ignore that transaction card. To confirm, simply click on the transaction and look on Zapper or on the explorer to confirm it is indeed a failed transaction.

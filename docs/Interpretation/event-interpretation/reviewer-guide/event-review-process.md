### Rejecting an Event

Some events may need to be rejected for various reasons:
- The event has already been interpreted (duplicate)
- The event needs more details to be complete, and these details couldn't be found through research
- Duplicate submissions from the same user
- Spam submissions lacking substantive information

After hitting the “Reject” button and selecting a reason, the event status changes from Pending to Rejected.

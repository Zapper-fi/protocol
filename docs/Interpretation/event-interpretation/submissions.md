# Submission Process

Once you’ve written your event interpretation, go ahead and submit it! Once you click submit, your event interpretation is sent for review to the ReviewerZapper team and some community members with a reviewer role. Here’s how the review process works:
- We are generally reviewing to make sure the verbiage makes sense (e.g. is in the past tense) and is consistent. We may tweak the words submitted to align it with other event interpreters on the site or add details that were not available to you.
- If there is a new app that needs to be created to associate this event with, we’ll go ahead and add it.
- If the submission is all good to go, we will approve it, and your event interpreter will be deployed for all users to consume!
- If the submission has some issues, it may be rejected with a rejection reason. Common rejection reasons are if the submission is a duplicate of another submission that was pending or if the action was too vague to understand.
  
Note that you can monitor the status of your submissions and see rejection reasons in your [My Submissions](https://www.zapper.xyz/my-submissions) page.

## Events that cannot be interpreted at this time:

- Multi-sig transactions - we are working on interpreting these events at-scale
- Proxy contract transactions, like transactions interacting with Maker’s DSProxy contracts. We’re also working on interpreting these at scale, but they are weird

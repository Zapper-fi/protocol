Interpreters are built by "Curators" on Zapper Protocol's platform. Curators build and maintain interpreters. They are the ones who define the set of instructions that tell Zapper Protocol how to read and interpret onchain information.

ANYONE can be an interpreter. You don't need to know how to code to build an interpreter. All you need is knowledge of a particular investment and its smart contract, or what actually occured in a given transaction.

## How Do I Create an Interpreter?

Check out our various guides on how to build interpreters:

- [Event Interpreters Guide](/docs/Interpretation/event-interpretation/guide.md)
- [App Token Interpreters Guide](/docs/Interpretation/app-token-interpretation/guide.md)
- [App Contract Position Interpreters Guide - COMING SOON](/docs/Interpretation/app-contract-position-interpretation/guide.md)
<!-- TODO - update ACPI guide when ready for launch -->

## How Do I Find Uninterpreted Events, tokens, and investments?

If you're looking for popular events that are not interpreted, you can go to the [Events Curate page](https://zapper.xyz/curate/events).

<!-- TODO - add ATI, ACPI curate pages -->

## How Do I Track the Status of My Interpreter Submissions?

You can track the status of your interpreter submissions on your [My Submissions page](https://zapper.xyz/my-submissions). On that page, you can see the status of your submissions and the stats on how many events or wallets your interpreters have impacted.

Additionally, when the status of your submission changes, you will receive an push notification on the Zapper website. You can check your notifications by clicking the bell icon in the top right corner of the Zapper website.

<!-- TODO - add screenshot of notifications -->

## Do I get Credit for Building an Interpreter?

Yes! Curators who build interpreters are a critical part of Zapper Protocol's ecosystem.

- You can see how you stack up versus other curators on the [Curators Leaderboard](https://zapper.xyz/leaderboard).
- You can see how many interpreters you have submitted and their stats on your [My Submissions page](https://zapper.xyz/my-submissions).

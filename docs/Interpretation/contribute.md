# Contribute

Help us make blockchains readable to everyone! There are two main roles through which you can help Zapper Protocol initially:

1. **Curators** play a key role by scouting uninterpreted data and building interpreters. Anyone can start curating- no knowledge of coding is required.

2. **Reviewers** are the final layer before data is made available publicly. They review and validate the submissions from Curators to ensure the interpretation is correct. Reviewers are experienced Curators who have proven their ability to deliver accurate data to Zapper Protocol.

To get started contributing to Zapper Protocol, visit one of our guides:
